# Ajax
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use AJAX in my projects for the first time.

There were 4 Tasks - a new branch on each was created. 

Branch Task1 - creating a simple app displaying a random joke (using XMLHttpRequest). 

Branch Task2 - creating a simple app displaying a random quote (using jQuery Ajax Request).

Branch Task3 - creating a simple app to search a country and find out basic information about it (using restcountries.eu API). 

Branch Task4 - modifying the kanban board created within OOP repo by adding Ajax requests (columns and cards are saved on a server and won't disappear after refresing website).
